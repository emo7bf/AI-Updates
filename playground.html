<h1>KLA AI Insights – Weekly Digest</h1>

<h2>Subject: Enhancing Model Generalization through Fine-Tuning and In-Context Learning</h2>
<p>
    This week’s digest spotlights a new study from Google DeepMind and Stanford, with actionable insights on large language model (LLM) customization for real-world enterprise use.<br>

<h2>Deep Dive</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Fine-tuning:</b> Model weights are updated using your custom dataset. Pro: Fast, efficient at inference. Con: May generalize less robustly.</li>
    <li><b>In-Context Learning (ICL):</b> No model retraining—just add examples to the prompt. Pro: Best for generalization to new patterns/tasks. Con: More compute required at runtime.</li>
    <li><b>Hybrid (Augmented Fine-tuning):</b> Use ICL to generate new synthetic training examples, then fine-tune. This can outperform either method alone in real-world generalization.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Quotes of the Week</h2>

<blockquote>
    “Learning how to interact with AI is not unlike being someone who's really good at asking questions. Prompting AI is very similar. You can't just randomly ask a bunch of questions. Asking AI to be an assistant to you requires some expertise and artistry of how to prompt it.”<br>
    <span class="quote-source">— Jensen Huang, CEO of NVIDIA, as quoted in <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/jensen-huang-nvidia-ai-future/" target="_blank">WIRED</a></span>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “We thought it was roughly a 20-year mission, and amazingly, we're on track. It's somewhere around there, I would think.”<br>
    <span class="quote-source">— Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/25/05/45599346/why-googles-demis-hassabis-disagrees-with-co-founder-sergey-brin-on-when-agi-will-arrive-and-sets-a-much-higher-bar" target="_blank">Benzinga</a></span>

<blockquote>
    “Anybody who's a computer scientist should not be retired right now. They should be working on AI.”<br>
